function [STR]=MSPE_conds(C)
%% DESCRIPTION:
%
%   Default list of trial conditions.  An integer is used to lookup a
%   descriptive string.  This can be passed to other programs (e.g.
%   Presentation) for more "human readable" labels.
%
%   Maybe we can also use this to fill in conditions in the IN array
%   automatically?  We just say where and when, then this function fills in
%   the remaining information?  It will be ugly and clunky, but maybe it's
%   better than trying to remember everything all the time. Probably less
%   error prone overall.
